# Intentix
Intentix is an adaptive assistive system that enables individuals with motor disabilities to control digital devices using eye movement, intentional blinks, and voice commands. It stabilizes noisy motor signals, confirms intent safely, and works with standard webcams and microphones for accessible, hands-free interaction.
